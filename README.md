## The Vulnerability
In the May 2019, Microsoft disclosed a critical Remote Code Execution vulnerability [CVE-2019-0708](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708), 
in Remote Desktop Services (formerly known as Terminal Services). This vulnerability is **pre-authentication** -- meaning the vulnerability is wormable, with the potential to cause widespread disruption. 
Attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) messages to the target server and get arbitrary code execution with administrative privileges.
## RDP Virtual Channel
Microsoft Remote Desktop Services provides a user with open interactive Windows sessions remotely. It presents the user's Windows desktop by communicating with the user client using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) over port 3389/TCP. 
The RDP protocol has the ability to be enhanced through software extensions called [Virtual Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/termserv/terminal-services-virtual-channels). Example of functional enhancements might include: support for special types of hardware, audio, or other additions to the core functionality.  
These channels include standard Microsoft-supposed channels such as "rdpdr" (Redirection), "rdpsnd"(Sound), "cliprdr" (Clipboard sharing) etc. Users can write modules using the RDP API to support other channels. In addition to the above channels, Microsoft creates two channels by default: MS_T120 (used for RDP itself) and CTXTW (used in Citrix ICA).  
  

The vulnerability is related to virtual channels binding process of MS_T120 through "MCS Connect Initial and GCC Create" request.
More background information is available from [ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/5/27/cve-2019-0708-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-a-remote-desktop-services-vulnerability).  
As aforementioned in ZDI article, all virtual channels requested by client are created using termdd!IcaCreateChannel(). Then pointers to these channel structures are stored within a table, which we shall call *ChannelPointerTable*. 
When a connection is established with RDP client, all static virtual channels including MS_T1209 are initialized internally by Windows RDP server and pointed by *ChannelPointerTable* .  
Note that MS_T120 is always present in Slot 0x1F.

The following code snippet was taken from termdd.sys.   
![TODO:Bind_MS_T120_To_31](./data/)  

## Root cause Analysis
A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Windows RDP kernel driver, termdd.sys. 
A problem is that when client specify channel with name `MS_T120\x00` during "MCS Connect Initial and GCC Create", termdd!IcaCreateChannel() calls termdd!IcaFindChannelByName() and returns the
existing MS_T120 channel structure in Slot 0x1F. Then this channel structure is considered as a new virtual channel entry and stored in other Slot during "MCS Attach User Request". 
In other words, MS_T120 channel structure is pointed by two slots.
The following code snippet was taken from termdd.sys. (Slot 3)
![TODO:Bind_MS_T120_To_3](./data/)  

![ChannelPointerTable](./data/ChannelPointerTable.png)  
If an attacker then sends invalid data into the MS_T120 channel, termdd.sys close the channel using termdd!IcaCloseChannel(), clears the pointer at the slot.(Slot 3 in the running example)
However, the same pointer in Slot 0x1F isn't cleared. 
Subsequently, when the connection terminates, RDPWD!SignalBrokenConnection() is invoked, which in turn calls termdd!IcaChannelInputInternal() and attempts to destruct freed MS_T1209 channel structure again using the pointer at Slot 0x1F. A destruction procedure is invoked by vtable pointer within channel structure. This leads to a use-after-free condition. 

![TODO:Destruct_from_vtable](./data/)  

## Heap feng shui
As explained in previous section, RDPWD!SignalBrokenConnection() attempts to call destruction procedure from vtable pointer within freed channel structure. If attacker can write arbitrary data into the freed heap area, they can overwrite vtable pointer and lead arbitrary code execution.
